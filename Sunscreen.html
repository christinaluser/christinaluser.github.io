      <h1>sunscreen</h1>
      <p>
        Whenever we're exposed to the sun, it affects our skin in different ways. Some are good - it can boost our mood and influences our sleep-wake rhythm. 
        But some are more harmful; it causes skin cancer and sunburns, as well as fine lines and hyperpigmentation.We don't want people to be scared of the sun, but 
        we do encourage everyone to be smart and protect themselves. There are a lot of options nowadays of good sunscreens - not all of them are greasy, thick, and white!
        There are also some actives that make your skin more sensitive to the sun (like retinoids, AHAs, and benzoyl peroxide); if you're planning on using those in the 
        future, having a good sunscreen in your routine is a must. It’s important to use a good sunscreen to avoid fine lines, and hyperpigmentation! 
      </p>
      <h2 id="how-to">How To Use Suncreen</h2>
      <p>
        A SPF of at least 30 is recommended for daily use. Either use a thick layer of sunscreen, or two thinner layers which may result in better protection as you'll use more product. Not using enough product means 
        you won't get the labeled SPF! Make sure to apply your product 15 minutes BEFORE getting sun exposure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Don't rub your product into your skin, but try to distribute it evenly and then leave it alone. Often forgotten areas on your face include: the area around 
        your eyebrows, your nose and nose wings, and your chin.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you'll be in direct sunlight for extended periods of time, or the UV index is particularly nasty, use a product with higher protection or add another layer 
        of product before going out. Reapply sunscreen after swimming, sweating, or towelling off and ideally every 2 hours. Remember to use other UV protection methods
        on sunny days, such as wearing hats, sunglasses, and seeking shade!
      </p>
      <p>
        Apply sunscreen at the end of your AM skincare routine. If you use makeup, let the sunscreen dry completely before using any makeup products.
      </p>
      <h2 id="sunscreen-types">Types of Suncreens</h2>
      <p>
        There are many different cleansing options available, each with different benefits. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed so knowing the difference between each type 
        allows you to filter your options and makes finding that perfect cleanser for you a lot easier. Remember, there are no hard rules so use the following information 
        as a rough guideline and feel free to try any type of cleanser as long as your skin tolerates it. 
      </p>

      <h3 id="physical">Physical/Mineral Sunscreens</h3>
      <p>
        You’ll find that the most common active ingredients formulated for this category include zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. These ingredients are very gentle and 
        are especially great for sensitive skin types. They’re also non-comedogenic, and they offer very good overall coverage on the skin. What’s also worth noting is 
        that while zinc oxide and titanium dioxide can protect against UVA and UVB rays, zinc oxide is able to offer a bit more protection than titanium dioxide. So if
        you’re the type to go outdoors frequently, zinc oxide might help provide a little extra sun protection.
      </p>
      <p>
        The only downsides are the texture and feel. Sunscreens with titanium dioxide and zinc oxide typically have a thick and goopy texture that’s difficult to work 
        into the skin. It can also create a white cast or chalky appearance that might not be the best for darker skin types. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Some popular physical sunscreens are: 
        <a class="embedded-link" href="https://www.sephora.sg/products/supergoop-play-100-percent-mineral-lotion-spf-50/v/100ml" target="_blank">SUPERGOOP! PLAY 100% Mineral Lotion With Green Algae</a> and 
        <a class="embedded-link" href="https://www.yesstyle.com/en/make-p-rem-uv-defense-me-blue-ray-sun-cream-spf50-pa-70ml-70ml/info.html/pid.1069723721" target="_blank">Make P:Rem UV Defense Me. Blue Ray Sun Cream</a>.
      </p>
      <h3 id="chemical">Chemical Sunscreens</h3>
      <p>
        For chemical sunscreens, you’ll find avobenzone, oxybenzone, and octinoxate as some of the common ingredients for this category. And depending on the ingredient,
        they can absorb UVA, UVB or both! For example, avobenzone is great for blocking UVA rays, while octinoxate blocks UVB and oxybenzone filters both UVB and UVA 
        rays. But in case you’re wondering, most chemical sunscreens contain more than one ingredient to make sure you’re receiving full protection.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for the downsides, chemical sunscreens can be irritating to sensitive skin types and cause allergic reactions such as photosensitization for some people. So 
        if you’re someone who faced some discomfort or irritation from wearing sunscreen, you know the reason why. For others, chemical sunscreens can sting if it gets 
        into your eyes, especially if you’re applying around your eye area so that’s something to keep in mind. The ingredients in chemical sunscreens also have a 
        negative impact on coral reefs, so being environmentally friendly is important to you you may want to look into reef-safe chemical sunscreens.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some popular chemical sunscreens are: 
        <a class="embedded-link" href="https://kravebeauty.com/products/the-beet-shield" target="_blank">Krave The Beet Shield</a> and 
        <a class="embedded-link" href="https://puritoen.com/product/centella-green-level-unscented-sun/54/" target="_blank">PURITO Centella Green Level Unscented Sun</a>.
      </p>
      <h3 id="hybrid">Hybrid Sunscreens</h3>
      <p>
        Hybrid sunscreens are products that contain filters found in both mineral and chemical sunscreens. So you might find a combination of zinc oxide, 
        titanium dioxide, or both, with avobenzone, octinoxate, and other UV filters rolled into one product.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some popular hybrid sunscreens are: 
        <a class="embedded-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Cell-Fusion-Laser-Sunscreen-1-69oz/dp/B07584B32N" target="_blank">Cell Fusion C Laser Sunscreen 100 SPF50+/PA+++</a> and 
        <a class="embedded-link" href="https://www.amazon.ca/Biore-JAPAN-Bright-Face-Sarasara/dp/B00IHPJKN8" target="_blank">Biore KAO JAPAN Bright Face Milk Sarasara UV SPF 50+ PA++++</a>.
      </p>
      <h2 id="spf-moisturizers">Moisturizers with SPF</h2>
      <p>
        You can combine moisturizer and sunscreen into one step by using a moisturizer with SPF. However, most moisturizers containing an SPF compromise their hydrating 
        properties to accommodate the sunscreen, so keep that in mind. It is also recommended that you use a moisturizer that doesn't contain SPF at night because
        when your skin is repairing itself, it's better to use a moisturizer formulated to improve the skin's function.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reminder: if a moisturizer + spf is your main sunscreen, treat it like a sunscreen! Don’t skimp out on application just because it has moisturizer in the name -
        otherwise, you won’t get the full protection specified.
      </p>
