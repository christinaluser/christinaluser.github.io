      <h1>moisturizer</h1>
      <p>
        Now that your skin is nice and clean, we need to moisturize! When you cleanse, the oils that help keep our skin supple and moisturised are removed no matter 
        how gentle your cleanser is. We use a moisturizer to restore the moisture and add other beneficial ingredients to our skin.
        A good moisturizer nourishes the skin and improves our skin's barrier. That helps treat and prevent obvious things like dryness, but also less-obvious concerns 
        like oiliness, acne, fine lines, and leftover acne marks. It’s especially important to have a good moisturizer (or a few!) if you plan on using any potentially 
        irritating actives in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many types of moisturizing products - from the very light to the very thick. Typically, the thicker the product, the more moisturizing it is. 
        You may find one moisturizer that you love, or you may want to layer a couple different products. Play around with it and see what works for you!  It's important 
        that moisturizer leaves your skin feeling bouncy and supple - happy and healthy, not dry and tight.
      </p>
      <h2 id="how-to">How To Use</h2>
      <p>
        You should always apply moisturizer on clean skin. For best results, apply a nickle sized amount of moisturizer shortly after cleansing, before your skin is totally
        dry. Moisturizers are most effective if you use them while your skin is still damp because damp skin absorbs the product more readily. That also gives the 
        moisturizer the chance to lock in that hydration.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are layering products, you want to start with the lightest products and work your way up to the thickest product. The idea is that, by layering products in this order,
        the thicker ones won’t prevent the thinner ones from getting to your skin.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remember to be gentle with your skin try to apply in upwards motions to prevent premature wrinkles and even saggy skin over time. If a product causes serious 
        irritation (eg.stinging, rashes, prolonged redness) drop it!
      </p>
      <h2 id="moisturizer-type">Types of Moisturizers</h2>
      <p>
        Moisturizers typically contain 3 kinds of ingredients: humectants, emollients, and/or occlusives. See the table below to see a break down of each ingredient type.

          </tr>
        </table>
      </p>

      <h3 id="gel">Gels</h3>
      <p>
        These usually contain humectants and have a cooling effect on the skin. They absorb pretty easily so they are suitable for a all different skin types.
        Gels are especially great for those who want lightweight hydration without the greasy feeling.

      <h3 id="balm">Balms</h3>
      <p>
        Balms are the thickest moisturizers available on the market and they have a high concentration of oils and lipids compared to water. This ratio makes them a 
        bad fit for oily and combination skin types. They have a sticky feeling and they sit heavy on the skin and many may be comedogenic so they are onyl suitable
        for very dry skin types.

      <h3 id="lotion">Lotions</h3>
      <p>
        For those who suffer from oily or combination skin, lotions can be extremely helpful. These are lightweight, yet offer a sufficient amount of hydration. 
        Their main ingredient type is emolient so make sure you choose one that’s non-comedogenic (that does not clog pores).
