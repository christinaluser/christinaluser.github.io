    <h1>overview</h1>
    <p>
      Before we get started with actual products, there are a few necessary steps you need to take. You will need to assess the current state of your skin in order to 
      determine what products you need to use.
    </p>
    <h2 id="skin-type">Determining Your Skin Type</h2>
    <p>
      Everyone's skin is different, but there are some broad categories that we use to distinguish different kinds of skin. Those are called skin types; they specify 
      how your skin generally looks and reacts and what it needs. The most common skin types are dry, oily, combination, and normal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Knowing your skin type will be helpful for figuring out what products to use in your routine and later on products to add to your routine. However there are no 
      hard rules in skin care, just use whatever works for you! Skin type is not an exact science, and your skin's behaviour can change. For instance, your skin type 
      may change when you move to a different climate, when you get older, or when you take certain medications. In addition, the same products might work as well for 
      someone with oily skin as it does for dry skin. So use skin types as a loose guideline rather than something to strictly adhere to. Below are some descriptions of 
      common skin types. If you've read up on skin types and still aren’t sure where your skin fits, that's okay! You’ll figure out what your skin likes and dislikes 
      as you go along.
    </p>
    <h3 id="dry-skin">Dry Skin</h3>
    <p>
      Dry skin under-produces sebum, your skin’s natural oil. Sebum works to waterproof your skin, preventing moisture from evaporating out of your skin into the 
      surrounding air. Dry skin doesn’t create as much of this waterproofing wonder-substance, so it’s prone to losing moisture. Dry skin often feels tight, flaky, or 
      itchy. If you wash your face and don’t apply any products, after a couple of hours your skin will feel dry or tight instead of oily.
    </p>
    <h3 id="oily-skin">Oily Skin</h3>
    <p>
      It’s the opposite of dry skin, essentially – oily skin over-produces sebum. Fun fact: P. acnes, the bacteria that causes acne, eats sebum as its main fuel source, 
      which is why oily-skinned folks are more prone to acne. If you wash your face and don’t put on any products, your skin will feel oily and shiny within a couple of 
      hours. Be aware, though, that in many cases, people assume they have an oily skin type when they actually have a dehydrated skin condition, and their oiliness can 
      actually be treated and managed.
    </p>
    <h3 id="combination-skin">Combination Skin</h3>
    <p>
      This type of skin is oily in certain places (typically the forehead, nose, and maybe chin) and dry in others (typically the cheeks and jawline).If your face 
      doesn’t react uniformly to the “wash and wait” test – that is, if you get oily in some places and tight in others – you’re probably same-face combo. Also, if you 
      find that certain areas of your face love a particular skincare product while other areas hate it, this is probably your type. Once again, though, the skin 
      condition of dehydration is often misinterpreted as the skin type of combination. Dehydration can cause skin that’s simultaneously dry and oily thanks to a damaged 
      moisture barrier.
    </p>
    <h3 id="normal-skin">Normal Skin</h3>
    <p>
      Your skin produces just the right amount of sebum all over your face. Congratulations. I’m not bitter at all. Your skin rarely feels either tight or greasy. 
      Your skin doesn’t flake off, nor does it get shiny by the end of the day. The clouds part and the sun shines bright when you step outside. Small woodland creatures 
      help you get dressed in the morning.
    </p>

    <h2 id="mindset">Getting Into The Right Mindset</h2>
    <p>
      If you go into this process with the wrong mindset, skincare can end up being incredibly confusing, frustrating, and disappointing. It’s easy to burn yourself out 
      (and burn a hole in your pocket!) by trying too many new products, which may not give you the results you were expecting. Prevent that burnout by preparing your 
      brain, knowing what to expect, and getting into the right mindset!
    </p>
    <p>
      Here are some things to keep in mind:
      <ul>
        <li>Skincare is a lot of trial and error! Introducing new products slowly is your best bet for finding what works for you.</li>
        <li>There is no perfect solution. What works for one person might not work for you, and vice versa.</li>
        <li>Keep in mind that we often compare ourselves to ‘ideal skin’ pictures that have fantastic lighting, angles, photoshop, facetune, and makeup. </li>
        <li>Some products have immediate effects, but many skincare products are long term treatments that may not start having effects for weeks or months.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h2 id="budget">Creating your Budget</h2>
    <p>
      Creating a skincare routine isn't a one-time thing; you don't just buy a bunch of products and you're done. It's a process; you have to figure out what your skin 
      likes and doesn't like. You'll buy a cleanser that ends up irritating your skin, or a moisturiser that's way too heavy. And you'll have to spend more money to 
      find a replacement. So skincare isn't a one-time expense; it'll become part of your monthly spending habit, and you should plan accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before making any purchases, come up with a reasonable budget that fits your lifestyle - and stick to it!
    </p>
    <h2 id="routine">Establishing Your Routine</h2>
    <p>
      To start, your routine will include 3 core components: Cleaser, Moisturizer and Sunscreen. We will get into the details of each component in their respective tabs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ideally you should have a night and routine. here is a general routine for you to get started with:
    </p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Morning</th>
        <th>Night</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <p>
            <ol>
              <li>Cleanser</li>
              <li>Moisturizer</li>
              <li>Sunscreen</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
        </td>
        <td>
          <p>
            <ol>
              <li>Cleanser</li>
              <li>Moisturizer</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      Feel free to deviate from this routine as needed - for example, some people may not need to use a moisturizer in the AM (especially if their sunscreen is 
      moisturizing!), and that’s ok! Do what works for you.
    </p>
